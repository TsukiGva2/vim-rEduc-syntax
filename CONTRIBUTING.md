# Contributing
thanks for considering contributing to this code! this document will tell you:

# opening a pull request

if you ever stumble upon an opportunity, whether it is:

- a sugestion
- an improvement
- a bugfix
- something that i forgot to add

you will have three options:

1. open a pull request with the desired modifications
2. create an issue
3. do nothing

this section is about the first option.

## creating the pull request

it's pretty simple:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Write your code.
3. Issue a pull request.

remember to write a good description that describes your PR with great detail, it helps me understand what you were trying to add/remove/fix.

# creating an issue

you should create an issue if you aren't sure how to do it or don't have time for it, or if it is an idea or a sugestion, anyway, here is how to do it:

1. create the issue.
2. describe the problem/sugestion.

and you're done! i didn't even need a CONTRIBUTING.md for just saying that, but, i thought it would be fun to write about it.
